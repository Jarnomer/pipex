## üìù General

Goal of the project is to run multiple `unix` commands with `execve` by creating child processes with `fork` and communicating between them using `pipe`.

It also features `redirections` to file descriptors using `dup` and `dup2`.

Project `passes` many of the 42 `testers`, including [franzinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) `strict` excluding quotes and backslashes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

For studies perspective I `highly` recommend that you finish the `bonus` part of this project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

GNU `make` and `gcc` are required to build and compile the project.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Jarnomer/pipex.git pipex
```

## ‚ö° Usage

Pipex needs an `infile` to open, at least `two` unix `commands` and `outfile` to `truncate` the result:

```bash
./pipex "Makefile" cat 'wc -l' outfile
```

Will be the same as `bash` syntax:

```bash
< Makefile cat | wc -l > outfile
```

Additionally `heredoc` with `EOF` and `multiple` unix commands are supported.

When heredoc is used, result is `appended` to outfile.

```bash
./pipex here_doc EOF cat cat 'wc -l' outfile
```

Will be the same as bash syntax:

```bash
<< EOF cat | cat | wc -l >> outfile
```

For my other 42 project and general information, please refer the [landing page](https://github.com/Jarnomer/Hive42).

I have also created error handling [unit testers](https://github.com/Jarnomer/Hive42) for `pipex`, `so_long` and `cub3d`.

### Cheers and good luck! ü•≥
